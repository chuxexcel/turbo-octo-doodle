                    another topic covered is Authentication(Username enumeration via different responses )→ about to do lab

22.11.2024     9h,  Studied lecture and workshop recordings. Studied Authentication and in an attempt to do the lab was finding it challenging to use the burb proxy. 
                    however, I was able to do another lab on sql injection to cover for the time spent.
                    
30.11.2024     7h    Went through lecture and workshop recordings.It was another challenge to get Docker running after installing Docker desktop. When I tried several times, I had to make arrangement to meet the teacher in person for him to put put me through on some of these tools (including on how to use burb on my browser).

03.12.2024     9h  Covered the remaining modules in Netacad. Went through therecordings for better understanding of the course

08.12.2024     3h  In an attempt to follow the walkthrough in the workshop recording, it seemed I made a mistake to remove a file I shouldn't as the teacher has done for a 
                   temporary container he added to Docker and going further to create a Gitroot folder on Vscode, i mistakenly stepped on my keyboard and have tried so 
                   many things to get my Vscode to wha it used to be and now may require some assistance to restore my Vscode environment to its usual state.
