16-17.11.2024, 12h,lecture&workshop recording for clarity on the course;

17.11.2024,    6h, ,SQL injection(SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data → Reflection),first lab done
                    another topic covered is Authentication(Username enumeration via different responses )→ about to do lab

22.11.2024     9h,  Studied lecture and workshop recordings. Studied Authentication and in an attempt to do the lab was finding it challenging to use the burb proxy. 
                    however, I was able to do another lab on sql injection to cover for the time spent.
                    
30.11.2024     7h    Went through lecture and workshop recordings.It was another challenge to get Docker running after installing Docker desktop. When I tried several times, 
                     I had to make arrangement to meet the teacher in person for him to put put me through on some of these tools (including on how to use burb on my 
                     browser).

03.12.2024     9h  Covered the remaining modules in Netacad. Went through the recordings for better understanding of the course

08.12.2024     3h  In an attempt to follow the walkthrough in the workshop recording, it seemed I made a mistake to remove a file I shouldn't as the teacher has done for a 
                   temporary container he added to Docker and going further to create a Gitroot folder on Vscode, i mistakenly stepped on my keyboard and have tried so 
                   many things to get my Vscode to what it used to be and now may require some assistance to restore my Vscode environment to its usual state.
                   
11.12.2024    5h   Made effort to restore the vscode but the docker seemed not to be in order to proceed with Booking System project phase1 but the teacher's assistance,some 
                   progress was made

19.12.2024    3h   Went through the recording for a better understanding of the concepts of the Booking System projects and to familiarize myself with the GDPR concepts
(not sure of the exact date)

27.12.2024    5h   I tried to do some labs on Portswigger as I was learning alot from there.I started again with Authentication but succeded with the first lab and found it 
                   a little difficult to proceed further with the community version of Burp suit.Following the guidance from some video in the community solution, i observed 
                   their demonstration doesn't reflect with what I was seeing on my Burp and it was almost frustrating a it took so much time from my schedule.Enabling 
                   inerception also affected the progress of the browser. I had to suspend the exercise.

28.12.2024   5h    Going through the demonstration videos again and reflecting why it wasn't working as expected on my Burp, i observed the Burp professional made a lot of 
                   difference from the Burp community version and so I installed  trial version of Burp professional and with it I was able to do 3 labs on Access control 
                   vulnerabilities.

29.12.2024  5h    Seeing the progress I have been ableto make on the Access control vulnerabilities labs with the professional version of Burp, I decided to do 2 additional 
                  labs in Access controlto make it 5 and seeing the difference this version makes, I also completed an additional lab on authentication. However, as today 
                  seems to be the date for submission of the tasks for this course, I had to prepare my report to submit but with the intention of going through the videos 
                  in this course to enrich my knowledge of Cybersecurity.
